# Smartphone Price Prediction (Supervised Learning)

This project predicts the **price category of smartphones** based on their technical specifications using supervised learning.  

**Key steps in the workflow:**
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🔧 Data Preprocessing (scaling, train-test split)  
- 🤖 Model Development (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- 📈 Evaluation (F1-score, classification reports, confusion matrices)  
- 🔍 Model Interpretation (feature importance)  

**Highlights:**
- Dataset: [Mobile Price Classification (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification)  
- Best Model: **Random Forest** (highest F1-score, interpretable)  
- Business Impact: Helps **Appclick** design competitive phones and price them strategically.
